A quick document to outline the naming conventions for the assets.

Each asset will have a Prefix, Middle and Suffix.
Prefix: Shows what type of asset it is.
Middle: Explains in text form what the asset is meant to be. (Won't require any further explaination)
Suffix: If an asset has variations it will have a suffix to distinguish between different variants

####################################
Prefixes            
C_                  Chef/Customer
E_                  Entity/Element (anything that can be picked up)
M_                  Menu/UI Components (so far just the Chef's Inventories)
T_                  Tiles/Tileset (anything that makes up the floor)
